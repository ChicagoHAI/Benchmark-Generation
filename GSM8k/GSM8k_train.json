        "Let G be the number of gold coins and S be the number of silver coins. We know that G = S + 30 and G + S = 110 . If we substitute the first equation into the second equation, we get S + 30 + S = 110. Combining like terms, we get 2S + 30 = 110. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40. Substituting that value back into the first equation, we get G = 40 + 30 = 70. Therefore, the answer is 70. Answer this question based on the passage: How many more gold coins than silver coins does Gretchen have? Think carefully first, then make a decision:\nTo find out how many more gold coins than silver coins Gretchen has, we can use the information given in the problem.\n\nWe know that:\n1. Gretchen has 110 coins in total.\n2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.\n\nLet's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. According to the problem, we have:\n\nG = S + 30\n\nSince the total number of coins is 110, we can write another equation:\n\nG + S = 110\n\nNow, we can substitute the first equation into the second one:\n\n(S + 30) + S = 110\n2S + 30 = 110\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\n2S = 80\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nS = 40\n\nNow that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the first equation:\n\nG = S + 30\nG = 40 + 30\nG = 70\n\nSo, Gretchen has 70 gold coins and 40 silver coins. To find out how many more gold coins than silver coins she has, we can subtract the number of silver coins from the number of gold coins:\n\n70 - 40 = 30\n\nTherefore, Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.\nYou are correct.

If a customer buys a total of 18 candies and spends exactly $20.25, how many of each type of candy did they buy? [Answer]Let x be the number of chocolate bars and y be the number of lollipops. We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:\n\nx + y = 18 (equation 1: total number of candies)\n1.50x + 0.75y = 20.25 (equation 2: total cost)\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method. First, we'll multiply equation 1 by 0.75 to make the coefficients of y in both equations equal:\n\n0.75(x + y) = 0.75(18)\n0.75x + 0.75y = 13.5 (equation 3)\n\nNow, subtract equation 3 from equation 2:\n\n(1.50x + 0.75y) - (0.75x + 0.75y) = 20.25 - 13.5\n0.75x = 6.75\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.75 to find the value of x:\n\nx = 6.75 / 0.75\nx = 9\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into equation 1 to find the value of y:\n\n9 + y = 18\ny = 18 - 9\ny = 9\n\nSo, the customer bought 9 chocolate bars and 9 lollipops.

To do this, we need a common denominator, which is 12 in this case: (4 / 12) - (3 / 12) = 1 / 12.\n\nTo express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1 / 12) * 100 = 8.33%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8.33%. \n\nSo, the answer is 8.33.",

        "Step-by-step reasoning process: First find how much longer it takes to heat up to 400 degrees: 400 degrees - 300 degrees = 100 degrees. Then multiply that amount of time by 40% to find the length of time: 100 degrees * 40% = 40 degrees. Then add that amount of time to the initial heating time to find the total heating time: 20 minutes + 40 minutes = 60 minutes. Then subtract 5 minutes to find the total cooking time: 60 minutes - 5 minutes = 55 minutes. So the answer is 55. What percentage of the total time was spent heating the oil? Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: First, we need to determine the total time spent on the entire process. This includes heating the oil and cooking the chicken.\n\nWe already know:\n- Heating the oil to 300 degrees takes 20 minutes.\n- Heating the oil to 400 degrees takes 40% longer than heating it to 300 degrees, which is 20 minutes * 40% = 8 minutes.\n- Therefore, heating the oil to 400 degrees takes 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.\n- Cooking the chicken takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat the oil, which is 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total time spent on the entire process:\nTotal time = Time to heat the oil (28 minutes) + Time to cook the chicken (23 minutes) = 51 minutes.\n\nTo find the percentage of the total time spent heating the oil, we use the following formula:\n\nPercentage = (Time spent heating the oil / Total time) * 100\n\nPercentage = (28 minutes / 51 minutes) * 100 \u2248 54.90%\n\nSo, approximately 54.90% of the total time was spent heating the oil.\nYou are correct that the total time spent on the entire process is 51 minutes, and the time spent heating the oil is 28 minutes. To find the percentage of the total time spent heating the oil, you used the correct formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Time spent heating the oil}}{\\text{Total time}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{28}{51} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 54.90\\% \\]\n\nSo, approximately 54.90% of the total time was indeed spent heating the oil.

We know that on Saturday he sold 20 crates, on Tuesday 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and on Thursday 18 crates. So, the total is 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates. Since Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, we subtract those two days from his weekly target. His target was to sell 120 crates, so after accounting for the two days he was closed, his adjusted target is 120 - (120 / 7 * 2) = 120 - 34.29 = 85.71 crates. Since Sam cannot sell a fraction of a crate, we round this to the nearest whole number, which is 86 crates.

        "First, we need to determine how many ice cubes are used to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes as follows: 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes. Next, we calculate the weakening effect of these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters, so 5 ice cubes will weaken the coffee by 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters. Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening effect is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters. Thus, the answer is 75. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 75.",

If a customer buys a 10-pound mixture of these candies for $22, how many pounds of each type of candy did they buy? [Answer]Let x be the number of pounds of type A candy and y be the number of pounds of type B candy. We can set up the equation x + y = 10 (equation 1) because the total weight is 10 pounds. We can also set up the equation 2x + 3y = 22 (equation 2) because the total cost is $22. We can solve these equations simultaneously. From equation 1, we have x = 10 - y. Substituting this into equation 2, we get 2(10 - y) + 3y = 22. Expanding this out, we get 20 - 2y + 3y = 22. Combining like terms, we get y = 2. Substituting this back into x = 10 - y, we get x = 8. Therefore, the customer bought 8 pounds of type A candy and 2 pounds of type B candy. The answer is 8,2. [Question]A school has 100 students.

Since there were 4 boats and each boat carried away 5 cats, the total number of cats taken away by the boats is 4 * 5 = 20 cats. Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away by the boats from the initial number of cats to find out how many cats remained on the rock: 50 - 20 = 30 cats. Next, we need to find out how many cats ran after the mouse. Since 3 / 5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is 3 / 5 * 30 = 18 cats. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the number of cats that remained on the rock to find out how many cats were left: 30 - 18 = 12 cats. Therefore, the answer is 12. \n\nFinal answer: 12.",
        "First find how many months 2 years is, 2 * 12 = 24 months. Then subtract the 6 months of the introductory deal and the 8 months at the regular price, 24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months at the regular price of $14. Then multiply that number by the regular monthly price to find the total price for those months, 10 * 12 = 120. Then add that amount to the cost of the introductory period and the next 8 months to find the total cost, 120 + 6 * 8 + 8 * 12 = 232. Since the service increased its price after 8 months, we need to calculate the cost in two parts: the first 6 months with the introductory price and the remaining time at the regular price.\n\nFor the first 6 months, the cost is:\n6 * $8 = $48\n\nAfter the introductory period, the price increases to $12 a month for the next 8 months:\n8 * $12 = $96\n\nNow, for the remaining 10 months at the increased price of $14 a month:\n10 * $14 = $140\n\nFinally, we add all these amounts together to get the total cost for 2 years:\n$48 (introductory period) + $96 (first 8 months at regular price) + $140 (remaining 10 months at increased price) = $284\n\nSo, 2 years of the service cost Bill $284.

        "Let's calculate how many cards Kenny sold. He has $50 in spending cash and needs $100 for the ticket, so he got $50 from selling cards. Since each card was sold for $1.5, he sold $50 / $1.5 = 33.33333333 cards. Since he can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to 33 cards.\n\nNow, let's find out how many cards he kept. He kept 1/3 of his cards, and since he sold 2/3 of his cards to get the $50, we can set up the equation:\n\n(2/3) * x = 33\n\nWhere x is the total number of cards he started with. To solve for x, we multiply both sides by (3/2):\n\nx = 33 * (3/2)\nx = 49.5\n\nSince he can't have half a card, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means Kenny started with 50 cards.

If a customer buys 5 pounds of each type of candy, how much will they spend in total? [Answer]First, let's calculate the discounted price for each type of candy. For Candy A, the original price is $2 per pound and there's a 20% discount. So, the discount amount is 20 / 100 * 2 = $0.4. Thus, the discounted price for Candy A is 2 - 0.4 = $1.6 per pound. For Candy B, the original price is $3 per pound and there's a 10% discount. So, the discount amount is 10 / 100 * 3 = $0.3. Thus, the discounted price for Candy B is 3 - 0.3 = $2.7 per pound. Now, let's calculate the total cost for 5 pounds of each type of candy. The total cost for Candy A is 5 * 1.6 = $8. The total cost for Candy B is 5 * 2.7 = $13.5. Therefore, the total cost for both types of candy is 8 + 13.5 = $21.5. Therefore, the answer is 21.5. [Question]A school has 100 students.

[Answer]There are 100 / 2 = 50 girls in the school. There are 50 - 10 = 40 girls who do not have dogs. There are 50 boys in the school. There are 50 * 0.1 = 5 boys who have dogs. There are 40 girls who do not have dogs, so there are 50 - 40 = 10 girls who have dogs. There are 5 + 10 = 15 students who have dogs. Therefore, the answer is 15. [Question]A teacher has 19 candies to give to 4 students. What is the minimum number of candies that the teacher needs to add so that each student receives an equal number of candies? [Answer]\nTo divide the candies equally among the 4 students, the total number of candies must be divisible by 4. We can find the remainder when 19 is divided by 4: 19 / 4 = 4 R 3. This means that 19 candies leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4. To make the total number of candies divisible by 4, we need to add enough candies to reach the next multiple of 4 after 19. The next multiple of 4 after 19 is 20 (4 x 5). Therefore, the teacher needs to add 20 - 19 = 1 candy. Therefore, the answer is 1.",

        "First, we need to determine how much of the raisin bag will be used for each item. This is 1 / 3 because 1 \u00f7 3 = 1 / 3. Each batch of oatmeal cookies uses 3 / 4 cups of raisins. Now we can find out how many batches Heather can make by dividing the raisins used for cookies, 1 / 3, by the raisin amount per batch, 3 / 4. This can be represented as an equation: (1 / 3) / (3 / 4) = (1 / 3) * (4 / 3) = 4 / 9 batches. Therefore, the answer is 4 / 9. Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Heather has a total of 27 cups of raisins.\n2. She wants to divide the raisins equally among three items: oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix.\n3. To find out how much raisins are used for each item, we divide the total amount of raisins by the number of items: 27 cups / 3 = 9 cups per item.\n4. A batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins.\n5. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we divide the raisins used for cookies by the amount needed for one batch: 9 cups / (3/4 cup per batch).\n6. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so we have: 9 * (4/3) = 36/3 = 12 batches.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.",

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is $4032 - $3024 = $1008. Therefore, the answer is 1008. Answer: The total cost of Ada's electricity bill before adding the new device is 2016 kilowatts \u00d7 $1.50 / kilowatt = $3024. The total cost of Ada's electricity bill after adding the new device is 2688 kilowatts \u00d7 $1. 50 / kilowatt = $4032. The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is $4032 - $3024 = $1008.

The second half of the month also consists of 15 days.\n\nThe total savings for the second half of the month would be:\n\\[ 15 \\times 2x = 30x \\]\n\nElvis's total monthly savings target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total savings for the entire month:\n\\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 45x = 1125 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:\n\\[ x = \\frac{1125}{45} = 25 \\]\n\nSo, the daily savings in the first half of the month is $25. Since the daily savings in the second half is twice that amount, we calculate:\n\\[ 2x = 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, Elvis has to save \\(\\boxed{50}\\) dollars each day in the second half of the month.",

        "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to determine how many months the research took in total.\n   - The initial funding was for 5 months.\n   - The research ended up taking 10 times that long, so it took 5 * 10 = 50 months in total.\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the cost for each period of the research.\n   - For the first 5 months, the cost was $100,000.\n   - After the first 5 months, each month cost 50% more than the previous month.\n\n3. Calculate the cost for the remaining 45 months (50 total months - 5 initial months).\n   - The cost for the 6th month would be $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.\n   - The cost for the 7th month would be $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000.\n   - We can see that the cost increases by a factor of 1.5 each month.\n\n4. To find the total cost for the remaining 45 months, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n   - Sum = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n   - Where a is the first term ($150,000), r is the common ratio (1.5), and n is the number of terms (45).\n\n5. Calculate the sum for the remaining 45 months:\n   - Sum = 150,000 * (1.5^45 - 1) / (1.5 - 1)\n\n6. Calculate the total cost:\n   - Total cost = Initial 5 months + Remaining 45 months\n   - Total cost = $100,000 + 150,000 * (1.5^45 - 1) / (1.5 - 1)\n\nNow let's do the math:\n\n- 1.5^45 \u2248 1,898,142.53\n- 150,000 * (1,898,142.53 - 1) / (1.5 - 1) \u2248 150,000 * 1,898,141.53 / 0.5 \u2248 150,000 * 3,796,283.06 \u2248 569,442,459\n\nSo, the total cost for the research is approximately $569,442,459 + $100,000 = $569,542,459.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $569,542,459.

        "First, we determine how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. Since she has 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them, she trades 30 * 0.9 = 27 small stickers for large buttons. Next, we calculate how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. Since she has 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them, she trades 40 * 0.5 = 20 large stickers for large buttons. The remaining large stickers are 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers. These 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons, which means she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons. Now, we need to determine how many large buttons she gets from the 27 small stickers and the 20 large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, the 27 small stickers are equivalent to 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons. Adding the 20 large buttons from the large stickers, she gets a total of 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons. Finally, we calculate the total number of buttons she has. She has 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons, so the total number of buttons is 29 + 60 = 89. Therefore, the answer is 89. Answer: \\boxed{89}.",

Type A costs $2 per pound with a 20% discount, and type B costs $3 per pound with a 10% discount. If a customer buys 5 pounds of each type, how much does the customer pay in total?\n[Answer]First find the discount amount for type A by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage:. $2 / pound * 20% = $.40 / pound. Then subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price : $2 / pound - $.40 / pound = $1.60 / pound. Then multiply the sale price by the number of pounds bought to find the cost of the candy : $1.60 / pound * 5 pounds = $8.00. Now repeat the process for type B. First find the discount amount : $3 / pound * 10% = $.30 / pound. Now subtract the discount amount from the original price : $3 / pound - $.30 / pound = $2.70 / pound. Now multiply the sale price by the number of pounds bought : $2.70 / pound * 5 pounds = $13.50. Now add the cost of each type of candy to find the total cost : $8.00 + $13.50 = $21.50.

One software package costs $40 and covers up to 5 devices. The other software package costs $60 and covers up to 10 devices. How much money, in dollars, can the school save by buying the $60 software package instead of the $40 software package?\n[Answer]To cover 50 devices, the school would need 50 / 5 = 10 packages of the $40 software. 10 packages of the $40 software would cost 10 * 40 = $400. To cover 50 devices, the school would need 50 / 10 = 5 packages of the $60 software. 5 packages of the $60 software would cost 5 * 60 = $300. The school can save 400 - 300 = $100 by buying the $60 software. Therefore, the answer is 100. [Question]A company has 1000 employees. There will be three rounds of layoffs.

We know that the customer bought a total of 12 candies, so we have the equation:\n\n\\( x + y = 12 \\)\n\nWe also know that the customer spent exactly $15, with chocolate bars costing $1.50 each and lollipops costing $0.50 each. This gives us the second equation:\n\n\\( 1.5x + 0.5y = 15 \\)\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can first multiply the second equation by 2 to eliminate the decimals:\n\n\\( 3x + y = 30 \\)\n\nNow, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation:\n\n\\( (3x + y) - (x + y) = 30 - 12 \\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\( 2x = 18 \\)\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we find:\n\n\\( x = 9 \\)\n\nNow that we know there are 9 chocolate bars, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find the number of lollipops:\n\n\\( 9 + y = 12 \\)\n\nSubtracting 9 from both sides, we get:\n\n\\( y = 3 \\)\n\nSo, the customer bought 9 chocolate bars and 3 lollipops. Answer: 9 chocolate bars and 3 lollipops. So the answer is 9 chocolate bars and 3 lollipops. [Back to questions]",

If a customer buys 10 pieces of candy and spends exactly $25, how many pieces of each type did they buy?\n[Answer]Let's denote the number of Candy A pieces as \\(a\\) and the number of Candy B pieces as \\(b\\). We have two equations based on the given information:\n\n1. The total number of candies equation: \\(a + b = 10\\)\n2. The total cost equation: \\(2a + 3b = 25\\)\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can express \\(a\\) in terms of \\(b\\) from the first equation:\n\\[a = 10 - b\\]\n\nNext, substitute this expression for \\(a\\) into the second equation:\n\\[2(10 - b) + 3b = 25\\]\n\\[20 - 2b + 3b = 25\\]\n\\[20 + b = 25\\]\n\\[b = 5\\]\n\nNow that we know \\(b = 5\\), we can find \\(a\\) by substituting \\(b\\) back into the first equation:\n\\[a + 5 = 10\\]\n\\[a = 5\\]\n\nSo, the customer bought 5 pieces of Candy A and 5 pieces of Candy B.

His friend Bob would like to eat one more piece than George. Susie will eat half as many as Bob. Bill, Fred, and Mark would each like 3 pieces. How many slices of pizza will be left over? [Answer] First find the total number of slices from the small pizzas: 3 small * 4 slices / small = 12 slices. Then find the total number of slices from the large pizzas: 2 large * 8 slices / large = 16 slices. Add them to find the total number of slices: 12 slices + 16 slices = 28 slices. Bob wants 1 more slice than George, so he wants 3 slices / George + 1 slice = 4 slices. Susie will eat half as many as Bob, so she will eat 4 slices / 2 = 2 slices. Bill, Fred, and Mark will eat 3 slices / person * 3 people = 9 slices. George, Bob, Susie, Bill, Fred, and Mark will eat 3 slices / George + 4 slices / Bob + 2 slices / Susie + 9 slices / others = 18 slices. There will be 28 slices - 18 slices = 10 slices left.

Everyone had a go at the merry-go-round (at $3 per child). On their way home, they bought 2 cones of ice cream each (each cone cost $8). How much did they spend altogether? [Answer] 3 children rode the Ferris wheel, so Ferris wheel tickets cost 3 * $5 = $15. All 5 children rode the merry - go - round, so that was 5 * $3 = $15. All 5 children got ice cream, so that required 5 * 2 * $8 = $80. In total, they spent $15 + $15 + $80 = $110. Answer: \\boxed{110}. [Question]A movie theater can hold 50 people at a time.

The first equation represents the total weight of the mixture: x + y = 12. The second equation represents the total cost of the mixture: 2x + 3y = 24. We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Using substitution, we can express y in terms of x from the first equation: y = 12 - x. Substituting this into the second equation gives us: 2x + 3(12 - x) = 24. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 36 - 3x = 24. Combining like terms, we have: -x + 36 = 24. Subtracting 36 from both sides, we get: -x = -12. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get: x = 12. Substituting this value back into the equation y = 12 - x, we get: y = 12 - 12 = 0. Therefore, the customer bought 12 pounds of type A candy and 0 pounds of type B candy. Answer: \\boxed{12 \\text{ pounds of type A candy and } 0 \\text{ pounds of type B candy}}. [Question]A school has 100 students. Half of the students are girls, the other half are boys. 20% of the girls have dogs at home and 10% of the boys have dogs at home. How many students own dogs? [Answer]First find the number of girls: 100 students / 2 = 50 students. Then find the number of boys: 100 students / 2 = 50 students. Then multiply the number of girls by 20% to find the number that have dogs: 50 girls * 20% = 10 girls. Then multiply the number of boys by 10% to find the number that have dogs: 50 boys * 10% = 5 boys. Then add the number of boys and girls who have dogs to find the total number: 10 girls + 5 boys = 15 students. Answer: \\boxed{15}. [Question]A store sells 20 packets of 100 grams of sugar every week. How many kilograms of sugar does it sell every week? [Answer]\nFirst, find the total amount of sugar sold in grams: 20 packets * 100 grams / packet = 2000 grams. Then convert grams to kilograms: 2000 grams * 1 kg / 1000 grams = 2 kg.

        "First find how many degrees the air conditioner cooled the room on low: 2 degrees / hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees. Then find how many degrees it cooled the room on high: 3 degrees / hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees. Then find how much the room warmed up while the air conditioner was off: 2 degrees / hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees. Then add the temperature changes to find the final temperature change: 6 degrees - 12 degrees + 4 degrees = -2 degrees. Since the final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature, that means it is 2 degrees cooler. Therefore, the answer is 2.",
        "When the Comet last visited, Bill\u2019s dad was 30 years old and Comet Halley takes 75 years to make one visit, so that means that Bill\u2019s dad was 30 + 75 = 105 years old when he saw the comet the same time Bill saw it for the second time. That means the first time Bill saw the Comet, he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old. Hence, Bill saw the comet for the first time when he was 90 years old. Answer: 90.",

        "First, find the total number of flights the first plane makes: 44 flights * 2 = 88 flights. The first plane takes 3 / 4 * 88 flights = 66 flights to Greece. Subtracting those from the first plane's flights gives 88 flights - 66 flights = 22 flights. These remaining flights are split evenly between France and Germany, so the plane flies 22 flights / 2 = 11 flights to France per day. Therefore, the answer is 11. \n\nAnswer this question: A small aeroplane can seat 10 people in total. There must be at least one seat for each passenger on board. If 3/5 of the seats are occupied, how many seats are free? Step by step reasoning process below:\n\nTo determine the number of free seats on the small aeroplane, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Find the number of occupied seats.\nWe know that 3/5 of the seats are occupied. Since the plane can seat 10 people in total, we can calculate the number of occupied seats as follows:\n(3/5) * 10 = 6\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of free seats.\nNow that we know there are 6 occupied seats, we can subtract this from the total number of seats to find the number of free seats:\n10 (total seats) - 6 (occupied seats) = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 free seats on the small aeroplane.\nYou are an AI assistant that helps people find information.

        "Step-by-step reasoning process: If Tobias howls for 20 seconds, then Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. The combined howling time of the first two wolves is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, meaning he howls for 60 / 2 = 30 seconds. Therefore, the three wolves 'howls last for a combined length of time of 60 + 30 = 90 seconds which is 90 / 60 = 1. 5 minutes.\n\nSo the answer is 1.5.",
