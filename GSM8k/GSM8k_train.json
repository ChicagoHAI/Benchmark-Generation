        "First find the total number of eggs Janet uses each day: 3 eggs / day + 4 eggs / day = 7 eggs / day. Then subtract that amount from the number of eggs her ducks lay to find the number she sells: 16 eggs / day - 7 eggs / day = 9 eggs / day. Then multiply that number by the price of each egg to find her daily earnings: 9 eggs / day * $2 / egg = $18 / day. Therefore, the answer is 18.",
        "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed to make a robe, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required.\n2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required.\n3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together.\n\nStep 1: The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.\n\nStep 2: The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber required is:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\]\n\nStep 3: Now, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ (blue)} + 1 \\text{ (white)} = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
        "First we find the new value of the house by adding the initial $80, 000 + 150% of 80, 000 = $200, 000.  Then we subtract the cost of repairs and initial cost of the house to find profit: 200, 000 - 50, 000 - 80, 000 = $70, 000. Therefore, the answer is 70000.",

Each chicken is fed 3 cups of feed per day, so for Wendi\u2019s 20 chickens, she needs to provide 3 * 20 = 60 cups of feed per day. If 40 cups of feed are given in the morning and afternoon, then Wendi needs to provide 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed in the final evening feeding. Therefore, the answer is 20.",

        "Let V be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. She sold V / 3 from the green house, so she had V - V / 3 = 2V / 3 left. She sold 2 more to the red house, so she had 2V / 3 - 2 = 2V / 3 - 6 / 3 = (2V - 6) / 3 left. She sold half of this amount at the orange house, so she had (2V - 6) / 6 left. We know that (2V - 6) / 6 = 5, so 2V - 6 = 30 and 2V = 36. Therefore, Melanie started with V = 36 / 2 = 18 vacuum cleaners. Answer: \\boxed{18}.",
        "Out of 20 students, 20 x 20% = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.\nSo, 20 - 4 = 16 students were not enrolled in contemporary dance.\nAnd 16 x 25% = 4 students out of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance.\nSo, 16 - 4 = 12 students enrolled in hip - hop dance.\nThus, 12 / 20 x 100% = 60% of the students enrolled in hip - hop dance.\n\nAnswer this question based on the given paragraph: How many students enrolled in hip-hop dance? Based on the information provided in the paragraph, 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance. The calculation is as follows:\n\n- Total number of students: 20\n- Students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20 x 20% = 4\n- Remaining students after contemporary dance: 20 - 4 = 16\n- Students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining: 16 x 25% = 4\n- Remaining students after jazz dance: 16 - 4 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

If a customer buys a total of 10 pounds of candy and spends $24, how many pounds of each type of candy did they buy?\n[Answer]Let x be the number of pounds of Candy A and y be the number of pounds of Candy B. We can write two equations based on the given information:\n\nx + y = 10 (total weight of candies)\n2x + 3y = 24 (total cost of candies)\n\nWe can solve this system of linear equations using substitution or elimination method.

        "Let G be the number of gold coins and S be the number of silver coins. We know that G = S + 30 and G + S = 110 . If we substitute the first equation into the second equation, we get S + 30 + S = 110. Combining like terms, we get 2S + 30 = 110. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40. Substituting that value back into the first equation, we get G = 40 + 30 = 70. Therefore, the answer is 70. Answer this question based on the passage: How many more gold coins than silver coins does Gretchen have? Think carefully first, then make a decision:\nTo find out how many more gold coins than silver coins Gretchen has, we can use the information given in the problem.\n\nWe know that:\n1. Gretchen has 110 coins in total.\n2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.\n\nLet's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. According to the problem, we have:\n\nG = S + 30\n\nSince the total number of coins is 110, we can write another equation:\n\nG + S = 110\n\nNow, we can substitute the first equation into the second one:\n\n(S + 30) + S = 110\n2S + 30 = 110\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\n2S = 80\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nS = 40\n\nNow that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the first equation:\n\nG = S + 30\nG = 40 + 30\nG = 70\n\nSo, Gretchen has 70 gold coins and 40 silver coins. To find out how many more gold coins than silver coins she has, we can subtract the number of silver coins from the number of gold coins:\n\n70 - 40 = 30\n\nTherefore, Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.\nYou are correct. Based on the calculations, Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. The answer is 30. Well done for walking through the steps to solve the problem!

        "Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets. The total is 4 + 6 + 18 = 30 pets. Therefore, the answer is 30.",
        "Let's start by figuring out how old Corey is. Since James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, we can add 1 to James's age to find Corey's age: 10 + 1 = 11 years old.\n\nNow that we know Corey's age, we can determine Amy's age. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so we subtract 2 from Corey's age: 11 - 2 = 9 years old.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how old Jackson is. We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so we subtract 5 from Amy's age to find Jackson's age: 9 - 5 = 4 years old.\n\nSo, Jackson is 4 years old.\n\nAnswer: Jackson is 4 years old.",
        "Let's denote the original time that Gerald took to run the 400-meter hurdles as \\( G \\) seconds.\n\nAccording to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ L = G - 2 \\]\n\nWe are given that Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. So:\n\\[ L = 38 \\]\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for \\( L \\):\n\\[ 38 = G - 2 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( G \\):\n\\[ G = 38 + 2 \\]\n\\[ G = 40 \\]\n\nGerald's original time was 40 seconds. With his improved diet, his speed increased by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time.\n\nFirst, calculate 10% of 40 seconds:\n\\[ 0.10 \\times 40 = 4 \\]\n\nNow, subtract this from his original time:\n\\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\] seconds.",
        "The number of cats in the neighborhood is 2 * 60 = 120. The combined number of rabbits pets is 60 + 120 - 12 = 168. There are 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 pets in the neighborhood. Therefore, the answer is 348.",
        "There are 200 x 2 / 5 = 80 boys in Grade 5. So, there are 200 - 80 = 120 girls. And there are 120 x 2 / 3 = 80 girl scouts. Therefore, 120 - 80 = 40 girls are not in the girl scout. Therefore, the answer is 40.",
        "James slept 2 / 3 of what Harry slept, which is 2 / 3 * 9 = 6 hours. So Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 more hours than James. Therefore, the answer is 3.",
        "First find the total volume of tomatoes before they were cooked, which was 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces. Then divide the total volume by the volume per can to find the number of cans Freda added, which is 64 ounces / 16 ounces / can = 4 cans. Then divide the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes, which is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes / can = 12 tomatoes. Therefore, the answer is 12.",
        "Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x. We know that 20 more cars drove through in the second 15 minutes, and 5 cars exited the line. So, the total number of cars that remained after the traffic jam is x + 20 - 5 = x + 15. Since there were originally 30 cars, we can write the equation: x + 15 = 30. Solving for x, we get x = 30 - 15 = 15. Therefore, 15 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Answer: \\boxed{15}.",
        "The total number of potted plants that Mary currently has is 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants, across all the window sills. The total number of plants that she will give to her friends and family is 1 * 40 = 40 plants. The total number of potted plants that will be left with Mary is 80 - 40 = 40 potted plants. Since she also received 18 potted plants, she will have a total of 40 + 18 = 58 potted plants. Therefore, the answer is 58."
